# My Precious World - A Personal Carbon Footprint App

The project contains an easy to use and lightweight personal carbon footprint app. This was developed as part of a Keele University MSc research project. This app has been written using Flutter and the Dart programming language.

The purpose of this app is to address the following issues discovered in similar carbon footprint apps: -
> Only one visual representation for the interpretation of the results from carbon footprint calculation.
> Multiple code bases to manage multiple platforms.
> Applications with information overload and too many responsibilities per screen.
> General actions, rather than being specific to the user based on their results.
> No clear way to suggest a new climate emissions reduction action by users.
> Part of the app not working correctly or not clear in its state.
> Privacy concerns
> Occurrences of a lack of software development lifecycle and audit trail when creating apps

The app contains the following functionality:
> Registration and login
> A form containing a carbon footprint questionnaire
> View and management of results
> Access to climate change related links

This app can be run locally using an IDE which supports Flutter. A mobile emulatator (through Android Studio or Xcode), Web browser or connected physical mobile can be used to run the app
